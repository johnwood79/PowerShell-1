function Write-TsxOutPut{
<#
    .SYNOPSIS 
        This function is designed to allow someone who is first learning PowerShell to make better calls back to the host screen without
        needing to understand all of the ins and outs of Write-Error / Verbose / Warnings. This also allows you to bypass things like write-host completely.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
        This function can be called through out a script to show visual progress to a user of where the script is at when it's running. This is useful as it does not 
        trigger terminating error code messages or true 'warnings' that otherwise might be caused by a .NET write-error or other method. Also allows the user to color co-ordinate messages
        without using the write-host prompt.

    .PARAMETER MsgLevel
        This parameter only accepts a set of choices you can use the "Tab Key" to rotate through the options. The options are:
        Warning - Sets the font color to Yellow to indicate it didn't do what you wanted but didnt fail either
        Default - Sets the font color to Cyan - a neutral color that is readable and conveys progress
        Success - Sets the font color to green - You did something you wanted or a function completed succesfully

    .PARAMETER Message
        This parameter accepts strings and allows you to pass through strings that are supposed to be displayed in a specific color to convey status. 

    .EXAMPLE 
        Write-TsxOutPut -MsgLevel Warning -Message "Something is amiss"
        Example of running the code to generate a warning level message - or maybe it just indicates a tricky part is happening

    .EXAMPLE
        Write-TsxOutPut -MsgLevel Default -Message "This is normal execution"    
        Example of normal execution message back to the user. 
        
    .EXAMPLE
        Write-TsxOutPut -MsgLevel Success -Message "You made it"
        Example of success or finalized out put message it's green and happy.
